I did this Project both in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for interactive exploration.

In Jupyter Notebook using Data Quest Work Area and Submitted through that Now also uploaded through post the progress on Twitter and Facebook , Currently having trouble in LinkedIn cause of Pakistani CNIC is not in English ,can't prove not fake .

In Google Colab to upload in GitHub , and also upload .csv file for providing the data
